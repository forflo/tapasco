/** Tapasco is an automated tool flow for generating
  * threadpool architectures on FPGAs.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * The Tapasco flow composes hardware threadpools using
  * high-level synthesis and abstract architecture definitions, and
  * provides a uniform programming interface for such threadpools.
  * Its inputs are C/C++ kernels which are suitable for high-level
  * synthesis (see Xilinx UG902 for details on code restrictions),
  * which are composed into a fixed hardware threadpool. At runtime
  * TPC API provides methods to query the threadpool and its
  * currently loaded composition, and to setup, launch and collect
  * jobs to be executed on the threadpool.
