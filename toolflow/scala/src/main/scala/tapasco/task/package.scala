/**
  * Contains routines to launch parallel jobs and tasks via resource-aware scheduler.
  * The `task` package contains the main organization of parallel jobs in TPC: Each
  * [[Task]] implementation can be scheduled via [[Tasks]] instances, which contain
  * a [[ResourceMonitor]] to launch jobs only if their resource requirements are met.
  *
  * Jobs can also implement SLURM-support and launch their jobs as separate processes
  * using the SLURM compute cluster interface. Examples: [[HighLevelSynthesisTask]],
  * [[ComposeTask]].
